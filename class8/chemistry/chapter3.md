## Core Concepts
- **Matter Classification Tree**  
  - **Pure Substances**  
    - *Elements* → cannot be broken by chemical means; one kind of atom.  
    - *Compounds* → chemical combination of elements in fixed ratio.  
  - **Mixtures**  
    - *Homogeneous* (true solution, alloy, gas mixture) – uniform, single phase.  
    - *Heterogeneous* (suspension, colloid) – non-uniform, two or more phases.

- **Element Basics**  
  - ~118 known; metals, non-metals, metalloids.  
  - Symbol rules (1 or 2 letters; first capital, second lower-case).  
  - Mono-, di-, tri-atomic forms (He, O₂, O₃).

- **Compound Essentials**  
  - Fixed *mass ratio* (Law of Definite Proportions).  
  - Represented by **chemical formula**; properties differ from constituents.  
  - Types: *ionic* (NaCl), *covalent* (H₂O), *coordinate* (NH₄⁺).  
  - Can be decomposed by chemical means (electrolysis, heating).

- **Mixture Fundamentals**  
  - Variable composition; components retain individual properties.  
  - Separation possible by physical methods (filtration, distillation, chromatography).  
  - **Colloids vs Suspensions** (Tyndall effect, stability, particle size).

### Short- and Long-Answer Questions

1. **Define element, compound and mixture.**  
   Give two everyday examples of each and state one laboratory or industrial method you would use to identify or separate them.

2. **Homogeneous vs heterogeneous mixtures** – list any four differences in a comparative table and give an example for each difference.

3. Describe **three common separation techniques** (filtration, fractional distillation, chromatography), the property each exploits and a real-life use.

4. Explain how the **Law of Definite Proportions** applies to water and hydrogen-peroxide; contrast with the **Law of Multiple Proportions** for CO and CO₂.

5. **Colloids**  
   - Define dispersed phase & dispersion medium.  
   - Explain Tyndall effect and Brownian motion.  
   - Classify fog, milk, butter and paint with reasons.

6. **Alloys:** what they are, why we make them, and how properties (hardness, corrosion-resistance, melting-point) change.  
   Compare brass, bronze and stainless steel.

7. Describe the full procedure (with labelled diagram) for **paper chromatography of ink pigments**, including calculation of R<sub>f</sub> values.

8. **Reverse-osmosis vs simple distillation** for producing drinking water – principles, energy requirements, advantages and limitations.

9. A sample of air is separated into N₂ and O₂ on an industrial scale. Outline the **steps in liquefaction and fractional distillation of liquid air** and explain why CO₂/H₂O must be removed first.

10. Tabulate **five key differences between a compound and a mixture** (composition, properties, energy change on formation, separation method, melting-point).
