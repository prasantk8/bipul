# Chapter 7: Synthetic Materials  


---

## Core Concepts  

- **Introduction to Synthetic Materials**  
  - Synthetic materials are man-made substances prepared chemically, not obtained directly from nature.  
  - They are designed for durability, affordability, and specialized use.  

- **Types of Synthetic Materials**  
  - **Plastics**:  
    - Thermoplastics: Soften on heating; can be reshaped (e.g., polythene, PVC).  
    - Thermosetting plastics: Harden permanently on heating (e.g., bakelite, melamine).  

  - **Synthetic Fibres**:  
    - Rayon: Regenerated cellulose, known as "artificial silk".  
    - Nylon: First fully synthetic fibre; tough and elastic.  
    - Polyester: Strong, wrinkle-resistant fibre (e.g., Terylene).  
    - Acrylic: Wool-like fibre used in sweaters and blankets.  

  - **Rubbers**:  
    - Natural rubber: Obtained from latex of rubber trees.  
    - Synthetic rubber: Man-made (e.g., neoprene, buna-S, buna-N).  

- **Properties of Synthetic Materials**  
  - Lightweight, durable, corrosion-resistant, chemically stable, water-resistant.  
  - Adaptable properties based on need (stretchability, flexibility, toughness).

- **Uses of Synthetic Materials**  
  - Clothes, household items, packaging, building materials, medical devices, electronics, automotive parts.

- **Environmental Issues**  
  - Most plastics are non-biodegradable → environmental pollution.  
  - Microplastics contaminate oceans, soil, and enter the food chain.  
  - Need for recycling, proper waste disposal, and adoption of biodegradable alternatives.

- **Recycling Symbols on Plastics**  
  - PET (1), HDPE (2), PVC (3), LDPE (4), PP (5), PS (6), Others (7).  
  - Helps identify and sort plastics for recycling.

- **Emerging Future Materials**  
  - Bioplastics (from corn, sugarcane, algae).  
  - Compostable plastics.  
  - Smart synthetic materials: shape memory polymers, conductive polymers.

## Extended Learning (Optional)  

- **Polymer Chemistry**:  
  - Monomers link chemically to form polymers via polymerization.  
  - Addition polymerisation vs condensation polymerisation.  

- **Vulcanisation of Rubber**:  
  - Sulfur cross-links introduced to natural rubber → stronger, more heat-resistant material.  

- **Composites**:  
  - Mixture of fibres and resins (e.g., fiberglass, carbon fibre composites) for enhanced properties.

## Higher-Class Content (Preview)  

- Role of catalysts in polymer formation (e.g., Ziegler–Natta catalysts).  
- Impact of UV light on polymer degradation.  
- Conducting polymers in electronic devices (polyaniline, polypyrrole).  
- Recycling challenges for thermosets and mixed plastic wastes.

## Real-Life Applications  

- **Household**: Plastic containers, water tanks, raincoats, carpets.  
- **Medical**: Artificial joints (polyethylene), sutures (nylon), blood bags (PVC).  
- **Construction**: PVC pipes, acrylic sheets for roofing.  
- **Technology**: Kevlar in bulletproof vests, carbon fibres in aircrafts, biodegradable shopping bags.
