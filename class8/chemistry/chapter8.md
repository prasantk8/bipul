# Chapter 8: Metals and Non-Metals  
*(Part 1 of 4)*

## Core Concepts  

- **Physical Properties of Metals**  
  - Lustrous (shiny surface)  
  - Malleable (can be beaten into sheets)  
  - Ductile (can be drawn into wires)  
  - Good conductors of heat and electricity  
  - High melting and boiling points  
  - Sonorous (produce ringing sound when struck)  
  - Solid at room temperature (except mercury)  

- **Physical Properties of Non-Metals**  
  - Dull (non-shiny, except iodine)  
  - Brittle (break easily)  
  - Poor conductors of heat and electricity (except graphite)  
  - Low melting and boiling points (except diamond)  
  - Generally gases, some solids  

- **Chemical Properties of Metals**  
  - React with oxygen → form metal oxides (basic nature)  
  - React with water → form metal hydroxide + hydrogen gas  
  - React with acids → form salt + hydrogen gas  
  - React with other metals: displacement reactions  

- **Chemical Properties of Non-Metals**  
  - React with oxygen → form non-metal oxides (acidic or neutral)  
  - React with hydrogen → form covalent hydrides  
  - Rarely react with water or acids  
  - Non-metals can displace less reactive non-metals from compounds  

- **Reactivity Series**  
  - Arrangement of metals in order of decreasing reactivity.  
  - Potassium > Sodium > Calcium > Magnesium > Aluminium > Zinc > Iron > Lead > Copper > Silver > Gold.

- **Corrosion**  
  - Gradual destruction of metals by reaction with moisture, air, or chemicals (e.g., rusting of iron).  

- **Prevention of Corrosion**  
  - Painting, oiling, galvanising, electroplating, alloying.  

- **Uses of Metals and Non-Metals**  
  - Metals: buildings (steel), wires (copper, aluminium), machines, transport.  
  - Non-metals: oxygen for breathing, nitrogen for fertilisers, sulphur for medicines.
