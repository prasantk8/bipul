# Chapter 2: Physical and Chemical Changes
*(Part 1 of 4)*

---

## Core Concepts
- **Nature of Change**  
  - Any alteration in a substance’s properties, appearance or composition.

- **Physical Change**
  - **Key idea:** no new substance formed; chemical composition unchanged.  
  - Usually reversible by simple means.  
  - Energy change involves inter-particle spacing only.
  - Common examples: melting ice, boiling water, dissolving sugar, breaking glass.

- **Chemical Change (Chemical Reaction)**
  - **Key idea:** one or more new substances with new chemical properties produced.  
  - Often irreversible by simple physical methods.  
  - Evidences (indicators):  
    1. Colour change 2. Gas evolution 3. Precipitate formation 4. Energy (heat / light) change 5. Characteristic odour.

- **Comparison Table**

  | Feature                     | Physical Change                         | Chemical Change                                |
  |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
  | New substance formed?       | No                                      | Yes                                            |
  | Chemical composition        | Unchanged                               | Changed                                        |
  | Reversibility               | Generally reversible                    | Generally irreversible                         |
  | Energy involvement          | Low, mainly kinetic (state/shape)       | High; bonds broken/formed (exo/endothermic)    |
  | Mass conserved              | Always                                  | Always (Law of Conservation of Mass)           |
  | Example                     | Ice → water                             | Iron → rust                                    |

- **Energy Profile**
  - **Exothermic**: heat released → product temperature rises (e.g., combustion, respiration).  
  - **Endothermic**: heat absorbed → surroundings cool (e.g., photosynthesis, NH₄NO₃ + water).

- **Reversible vs Irreversible**
  - Not all physical changes are reversible (cutting wood).  
  - Some chemical changes can be reversed industrially (e.g., Haber process N₂+H₂ ⇌ NH₃).

- **Catalysts & Inhibitors (Preview)**
  - Catalysts speed reactions without permanent change (enzymes, Pt in converters).  
  - Inhibitors slow reactions (food preservatives).

- **Oxidation–Reduction Introduction**
  - Oxidation = gain O₂ / loss e⁻ / loss H. Reduction = opposite.  
  - Everyday: rusting, bleaching, cellular respiration.

- **Law of Conservation of Mass**
  - Total mass of reactants = total mass of products (demonstrated by sealed-vessel reaction of vinegar + baking soda).

- **Law of Conservation of Energy**
  - Energy is neither created nor destroyed, only converted (heat ↔ chemical).

- **Macro ↔ Micro Perspective**
  - Physical change: particle identity same; spacing/arrangement changes.  
  - Chemical change: intraparticle bonds break/form, yielding new particles.

### Activities / Home Experiments

| # | Activity | Learning Outcome |
|---|----------|------------------|
| 1 | **Glow-Stick Investigation** – snap two glow sticks, place one in hot water, one in ice-water; compare brightness & duration. | Demonstrates temperature effect on reaction rate and chemiluminescence. |
| 2 | **Rust Race** – set up iron nails in plain water, salty water, oiled water, and painted nail; observe rust over a week. | Shows role of moisture, salt, protective coatings in corrosion. |
| 3 | **Cold vs Hot Pack** – dissolve NH₄NO₃ in water (endothermic) and CaCl₂ in water (exothermic); measure temperature change with thermometer. | Visualises energy absorption vs release in dissolution processes. |
| 4 | **Baking-Soda Volcano** – combine vinegar and baking soda in a flask with a balloon over the mouth; balloon inflates with CO₂. | Links gas evolution to chemical change; verifies mass if done in closed system. |
| 5 | **Catalyst Test** – decompose H₂O₂ with (a) no catalyst, (b) MnO₂, (c) raw potato cube; measure time to produce fixed volume of O₂. | Shows catalysts (MnO₂, catalase enzyme) speeding reactions without being consumed. |
