## Core Concepts  

- **Chemical Reaction**  
  - A chemical change in which new substances are formed with new properties.  

- **Characteristics of Chemical Reactions**  
  - Change in state (solid, liquid, gas)  
  - Change in color  
  - Evolution of gas  
  - Change in temperature (exothermic or endothermic)  
  - Formation of precipitate (solid deposit from solution)  

- **Chemical Equations**  
  - Representation of a chemical reaction using symbols and formulae.  
  - Example: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O  

- **Balanced Chemical Equations**  
  - Number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.  
  - Law of conservation of mass: Mass can neither be created nor destroyed.  

- **Types of Chemical Reactions**  
  - **Combination Reaction**: Two or more reactants combine to form a single product.  
  - **Decomposition Reaction**: A single reactant breaks down to form simpler products.  
  - **Displacement Reaction**: A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from a compound.  
  - **Double Displacement Reaction**: Exchange of ions between two compounds.  
  - **Oxidation and Reduction (Redox Reactions)**:  
    - Oxidation: gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen.  
    - Reduction: loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen.  

- **Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions**  
  - Exothermic: Heat is released (e.g., combustion).  
  - Endothermic: Heat is absorbed (e.g., photosynthesis).  

- **Corrosion and Rancidity**  
  - Corrosion: Gradual destruction of metals (e.g., rusting of iron).  
  - Rancidity: Oxidation of fats and oils leading to bad smell and taste.
