# Chapter 6: Air and Atmosphere   

---

## Core Concepts  

- **Composition of Air**  
  - Major components: Nitrogen (~78%), Oxygen (~21%), Argon (~0.93%), CO₂ (~0.04%), and trace gases.  
  - Role of each component:  
    - Nitrogen: dilutes oxygen, moderates combustion.  
    - Oxygen: supports life and combustion.  
    - CO₂: essential for photosynthesis; greenhouse gas.  
    - Argon: inert atmosphere, used in bulbs.  

- **Structure of Atmosphere**  
  - Layers based on temperature variations:  
    - Troposphere (~0–12 km): weather phenomena.  
    - Stratosphere (12–50 km): ozone layer.  
    - Mesosphere (50–85 km): meteoroid burning.  
    - Thermosphere (85–600 km): auroras, ionosphere.  
    - Exosphere (>600 km): outer space transition.  

- **Properties of Air**  
  - Air is a mixture, not a compound (properties retained).  
  - Air has mass, exerts pressure, expands on heating, contracts on cooling.  
  - Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude.

- **Oxygen Cycle**  
  - Process involving photosynthesis (plants release oxygen) and respiration (animals consume oxygen).  
  - Maintains balance of oxygen in nature.  

- **Carbon Cycle**  
  - Movement of carbon among atmosphere, biosphere, oceans and geosphere.  
  - Key processes: photosynthesis, respiration, combustion, decomposition.  
  - Role of carbon sinks: forests, oceans.  

- **Air Pollution**  
  - Common pollutants: CO, SO₂, NOₓ, hydrocarbons, particulate matter.  
  - Natural vs anthropogenic sources.  
  - Effects: acid rain, global warming, smog, ozone depletion, health hazards.  

- **Greenhouse Effect**  
  - Trapping of heat by CO₂, CH₄, H₂O vapour, N₂O, CFCs.  
  - Natural greenhouse effect necessary for life.  
  - Enhanced greenhouse effect → global warming.  

- **Ozone Layer and Its Depletion**  
  - Ozone (O₃) absorbs harmful UV-B radiation.  
  - Depletion caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  
  - Effects: skin cancer, cataracts, reduced plant growth.  
  - Measures: Montreal Protocol (1987), eco-friendly refrigerants.  

- **Acid Rain**  
  - SO₂ and NOₓ dissolve in water forming H₂SO₄ and HNO₃.  
  - Damages monuments, soils, aquatic ecosystems.  

- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**  
  - Measures pollution level; classified as Good, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe.  
  - Monitors PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃ levels.

## Extended Learning (Optional)  

- Detailed chemical reactions of pollutants (e.g., NO + O₃ → NO₂ + O₂).  
- Photochemical smog formation: role of UV radiation and NOₓ.  
- Carbon footprint calculation and offsets.  
- Role of afforestation and reforestation.

## Higher-Class Content (Preview)  

- Greenhouse gases' GWP (Global Warming Potential) comparison.  
- Aerosols’ dual role: cooling (reflect sunlight) vs warming (absorb heat).  
- Atmospheric chemistry: Chapman cycle for ozone formation and destruction.  
- Climate models and future projections.

## Real-Life Applications  

- Oxygen cylinders for patients and mountain climbers.  
- Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies.  
- Air purifiers: HEPA filters, activated carbon adsorption.  
- Environmental monitoring using satellites (e.g., NASA’s OCO-2 for CO₂).  
- Urban planning for improving AQI: green belts, emission standards.
