## Core Concepts
- **Nature of Matter**  
  - Criteria: mass, volume, inertia  
  - Everyday examples showing “anything that occupies space and has mass”.

- **Particle Theory of Matter**  
  - Postulates (tiny particles, spaces, constant motion, forces)  
  - Evidence: diffusion of perfume, Brownian motion of pollen, etc.  
  - Limitations at very high pressure/low temperature (preview).

- **States of Matter**  
  | Property            | Solid             | Liquid                | Gas                 |
  |---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
  | Shape               | Fixed             | Takes container’s     | None (fills space)  |
  | Volume              | Fixed             | Fixed                 | Variable            |

    - b) Overall average density (hull + air inside) < density of water  
    - c) Salt water has zero density  
    - d) Water exerts upward pull on steel  

5.  Fogging machines use glycerine-water mist since:  
    - a) Glycerine is non-toxic and forms stable aerosol (colloid)  
    - b) Glycerine has low boiling point  
    - c) Mist scatters light uniformly  
    - d) Both a and c  

6.  A scuba diver carries compressed air tanks where air is liquefied by:  
    - a) Heating and compression  
    - b) Cooling and compression to reduce volume  
    - c) Addition of oxygen  
    - d) Sublimation of nitrogen  

7.  Cooking at high altitudes takes longer because:  
    - a) Temperature is lower  
    - b) Atmospheric pressure is lower, so water boils at <100 °C  
    - c) Heat capacity of air is high  
    - d) Humidity is low  

8.  Aerosol deodorants feel cold on skin due to:  
    - a) Compression of gas  
    - b) Rapid evaporation absorbs heat (latent heat)  
    - c) Chemical reaction  
    - d) Radiation  

9.  Autoclaves sterilise medical tools by steam under pressure because:  
    - a) Steam is dry  
    - b) Higher pressure raises boiling point, giving hotter steam  
    - c) Steam diffuses slower  
    - d) Moist heat expands metal  

10. Cloud seeding sometimes uses silver iodide as nuclei because AgI:  
    - a) Is an excellent solvent  
    - b) Has crystal lattice similar to ice, inducing condensation of super-cooled water droplets  
    - c) Absorbs CO₂  
    - d) Reduces temperature of clouds  


### Short- and Long-Answer Questions

1. **Define matter** and list three everyday examples that prove it occupies space and has mass.
