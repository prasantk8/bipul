# Chapter 9: Carbon and Its Compounds 

---

## Core Concepts  

- **Introduction to Carbon**  
  - Carbon is a versatile element; forms more compounds than any other element.  
  - Found in both free (diamond, graphite) and combined forms (carbonates, hydrocarbons).

- **Allotropes of Carbon**  
  - **Diamond**: Hardest natural substance, poor conductor of electricity.  
  - **Graphite**: Soft, slippery, good conductor of electricity.  
  - **Fullerenes**: Cage-like molecules (e.g., C₆₀ Buckminsterfullerene).

- **Properties of Carbon Compounds**  
  - Covalent bonding: sharing of electrons between atoms.  
  - Low melting and boiling points (compared to ionic compounds).  
  - Poor conductors of electricity (except graphite).  
  - Highly stable structures.

- **Versatile Nature of Carbon**  
  - **Catenation**: Ability to form long chains of carbon atoms.  
  - **Tetravalency**: Forms four covalent bonds with other atoms (C, H, O, N, etc.).

- **Types of Carbon Compounds**  
  - **Hydrocarbons**: Compounds made of carbon and hydrogen.  
    - Saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) – single bonds only.  
    - Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes) – double or triple bonds.  

- **Functional Groups**  
  - Groups of atoms responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions (e.g., -OH for alcohols, -COOH for carboxylic acids).

- **Homologous Series**  
  - Series of compounds with same functional group and similar chemical properties.  
  - Each member differs by a -CH₂- unit.

- **Important Compounds**  
  - Methane (CH₄): main constituent of natural gas.  
  - Ethanol (C₂H₅OH): alcohol used in beverages and as a fuel.  
  - Acetic acid (CH₃COOH): gives vinegar its sour taste.

## Real-Life Applications  

- Natural gas and petroleum as major fuels.
