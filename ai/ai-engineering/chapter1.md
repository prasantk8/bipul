# 🚀 Chapter 1: Introduction to Building AI Applications with Foundation Models

---

## 📌 Introduction to AI Engineering

Artificial Intelligence post-2020 is dominated by **scale**, referring to:

- **Data Volume**: Massive datasets from diverse internet sources.
- **Model Size**: Billions of parameters in models like GPT-4 and Google's Gemini.
- **Compute Power**: Requires specialized hardware and cloud infrastructure (GPUs, TPUs).

Foundation models underpin applications like **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, and **Midjourney**.

## 📌 Key Terminologies and Definitions

| Term                   | Definition & Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Foundation Models      | Versatile, large-scale models pre-trained on vast datasets, reusable across many tasks. |
| Large Language Models (LLMs) | Specialized foundation models trained specifically on extensive language data.    |
| Tokenization           | Breaking text into smaller units (tokens) like words or subwords for efficient processing. |
| Self-Supervision       | Learning without labeled data, models predict hidden/masked parts of data.             |
| Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) | Offering pre-built models via APIs (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude).       |
| Autoregressive Models  | Predict tokens sequentially using previously generated tokens (e.g., GPT-4).           |
| Masked Language Models | Predict missing tokens using context from both sides (e.g., BERT).                     |

## 📌 Foundation Models: Historical Context

Foundation models originated from early **language modeling research**:

- **1950s**: Claude Shannon's work on statistical modeling.
- **2017**: Introduction of **Transformers architecture** by Vaswani et al.

## 📌 Why Use Tokens?

**Advantages of tokenization**:

- **Efficiency**: Smaller vocabulary sizes.
- **Flexibility**: Handles unknown words via subparts.
- **Semantic Preservation**: Maintains meaning (e.g., `"cooking"` → `"cook"` + `"ing"`).

**Example from GPT-4**:

> "I can't wait to build AI applications"  
> → `["I", "can", "'t", "wait", "to", "build", "AI", "applications"]`

## 📌 Types of Language Models

### 🔹 Masked Language Models
- Predict missing words given context from both sides.
- **Example**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- Use Cases: Sentiment analysis, classification, debugging.

### 🔹 Autoregressive Language Models
- Predict next token based on previous tokens.
- **Example**: GPT (GPT-3, GPT-4)
- Use Cases: Text generation, coding, conversational AI.

## 📌 The Rise of AI Engineering

**AI Engineering** differs from traditional ML in the following ways:

| Aspect                 | Traditional ML Engineering                  | AI Engineering with Foundation Models                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection        | Requires large labeled datasets             | Uses pre-trained models with minimal fine-tuning     |
| Model Training         | From scratch                                | Utilize APIs, focus on prompting                    |
| Deployment             | Complex infrastructure                      | Simple, cloud APIs                                   |
| Cost & Accessibility   | High cost and entry barrier                 | Lower cost, democratized access                      |

## 📌 What AI Does Well (and Doesn't Yet)

### ✅ Strengths:
- Language understanding & generation
- Pattern recognition
- Content summarization
- Cognitive task automation

### ❌ Limitations:
- Factual accuracy (hallucinations)
- Ethical biases
- Long-context memory
- Common sense reasoning
